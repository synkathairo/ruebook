Shakespeare - *The Winter's Tale*

We designed a journaling web application which analyzes user sentiment and seeks to demonstrate what users are most stressed about. Mental health has been especially important in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore we decided to create a responsive website which gives mental health tips and serves to encourage users.
